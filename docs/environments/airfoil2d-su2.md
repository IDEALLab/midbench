airfoil2d-su2 Environment Documentation
-----------------------

The environment wraps the SU2 CFD solver, which we use for 2D and 3D aero and aero-structural examples. For now, the existing [2D airfoil tutorial](./tutorials/airfoil-su2-singularity/) provides the best overview for installing that specific example. As we add more examples, we will provide common installation instructions here.
