heatsink2d-dolfin-adjoint Environment Documentation
-----------------------

The environment wraps the FEniCS and dolfin-adjoint multiphysics solvers, which we use for a variety of applications and problems. For now, our only publically available example is the [2D Heat Conduction tutorial](./tutorials/heat-fenics-docker/) which describes how to install that specific example. As we add more examples, we will provide common installation instructions here.
