Contributing New Simulation Environments or Datasets
-----

While we designed the MID Benchmark Suite to contain a range of possible simulation baselines relevant to Inverse Design across a range of fields, we recognize that the provided environments are non-exhaustive. Moreover, as the solvers upon which our current environments improve, we recognize that others may wish to contribute updates to those environments. We are working on providing documentation for how to independently contribute your own simulation environments to add to the MID Benchmark Suite, but for now if you are interested in helping with this, reach out to the development team and we can provide further details.
